# .dotfiles

## Requirements:

- [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm)
- [zsh](http://www.zsh.org)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)

### Debian users
Debian users must have **vim-gtk** installed because Debian's default vim is not compiled with clipboard.

To install the dotfiles:

```
  git clone https://github.com/Phillywonka/.dotfiles.git
  env RCRC=$HOME/dotfiles/rcrc rcup
```
